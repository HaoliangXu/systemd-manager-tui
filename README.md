# Systemd manager tui

![rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

A program for managing systemd services through a TUI (Terminal User Interfaces).

This tool allows you to manage systemd services with ease. You can view logs, list services, view properties, and control their lifecycle‚Äîstart, stop, restart, enable, and disable‚Äîusing the D-Bus API.

## Usage

Must be run as sudo (or root).

**It's recommended to build a binary since it's simpler to run with sudo than to configure sudo to run "sudo cargo run".**

### Run in development mode
  ```
   sudo cargo run
  ```

### Build binary

1. Build the binary
    ```
      cargo build --release
    ```
3. Run it ( opcional )
    ```
      sudo target/release/systemd-manager-tui
    ```
