## Usage

Must be run as sudo (or root).

**It's recommended to build a binary since it's simpler to run with sudo than to configure sudo to run "sudo cargo run".**

### Run in development mode
  ```
   sudo cargo run
  ```

### Build binary

1. Build the binary
    ```
      cargo build --release
    ```
3. Run it ( opcional )
    ```
      sudo target/release/systemd-manager-tui
    ```
