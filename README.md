A program for managing systemd services through a TUI (Terminal User Interfaces).

This tool allows you to manage systemd services with ease. You can view logs, list services, view properties, and control their lifecycle‚Äîstart, stop, restart, enable, and disable‚Äîusing the D-Bus API. 

Additionally, it is possible to navigate between system services (sudo) and session services (user).
